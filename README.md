# Employment-Centers 
## Timeline for project:
  ### April 18: Project Proposal Due - Identify data sources and literature 
  ### April 22-26: Use LODES to identify geographic concentrations of employment and Calculate pedestrian and transit accessibility measures using Open-StreetMap and GTFS data
  ### April 29-May 3: Measure urban agglomeration, employment specialization, and comparative advantage. Examine change in employment specialization and/or spatial footprint over time. Create Presentation 
  ### May 6-10: Present Project to class on May 7 and Finalize tool to be usable and searchable.
